On the homepage there are three images each with alt descriptions.
There is a navigation bar at the top and bottom of the page, across a dark background that make it clear and visible.
When hovering over the navigation bar, the text boldens and the cursor changes to a pointer finger.
There is a lime green 'Return to Top' button at the bottom of each page.
I incorporated a lavender color palette that is pleasing to look at, and it keeps things organized.
The 'volunteer now' and 'search' button have been modified to fit the color palette.
Both buttons enlarge and bolden when hovering over. The cursor also changes to a pointer finger.
Images included are in line with our mission.
